Design overview
===============

This video is recorded @shenzhen chinese haskell meeting by @winterland1989, it explains almost every detail how do we combine GHC's lightweight thread with libuv's event loop in haskell-stdio.

Haskell-stdio combine GHC's lightweight thread with libuv's event loop, it use one I/O manager thread per capability, blow is the thread structures(style borrowed from [ghc-illustrated](https://github.com/takenobu-hs/haskell-ghc-illustrated)).
